# t - the smart tmux session manager

tmux is a powerful tool, but dealing with sessions can be painful. This script makes it easy to create and switch tmux sessions:

## Prerequisites

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (>=0.35.0)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (optional)

## How to install

### 1. Install tpm plugin

This script can be installed with the [Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm).

Add the following line to your `~/.tmux.conf` file:

```conf
set -g @plugin 'joshmedeski/t-smart-tmux-session-manager'
```

### 2. Add to path

To use the `t` script from anywhere, select your shell environment and follow the instructions.

**Note:** you'll need to check the path of your tpm plugins. It may be `~/.tmux/plugins` or `~/.config/tmux/plugins` depending on where your `tmux.conf` is located.

<details>
<summary>bash</summary>

Add the following line to `~/.bashrc`

```fish
# ~/.tmux/plugins
export PATH=$HOME/.tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin:$PATH
# ~/.config/tmux/plugins
export PATH=$HOME/.config/tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin:$PATH
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>zsh</summary>

Add the following line to `~/.zprofile`

```fish
# ~/.tmux/plugins
export PATH=$HOME/.tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin:$PATH
# ~/.config/tmux/plugins
export PATH=$HOME/.config/tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin:$PATH
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>fish</summary>

Add the following line to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

```fish
# ~/.tmux/plugins
fish_add_path $HOME/.tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin
# ~/.config/tmux/plugins
fish_add_path $HOME/.config/tmux/plugins/t-smart-tmux-session-manager/bin
```

</details>

### 3. Recommended tmux settings

I recommend you add these settings to your `tmux.conf` to have a better experience with this script.

```
bind-key x kill-pane # skip "kill-pane 1? (y/n)" prompt
set -g detach-on-destroy off  # don't exit from tmux when closing a session
```

### 4. Customize Prompt (optional)

If your terminal supports [Nerd Font symbols](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), you can customize your prompt.

```
set -g @t-fzf-prompt 'î¯ˆ  '
```

Or you can replace the prompt with anything you'd like.

## How to use

```sh
Run interactive mode
    t
    ctrl-a list tmux sessions and zoxide results (default)
    ctrl-s list only tmux sessions
    ctrl-z list only zoxide results
    ctrl-d list directories

Go to session (matches tmux session, zoxide result, or path)
    t {name}

Open popup (while in tmux)
    <prefix>+T"

Show help
    t -h
    t --help
```

By default, this plugin is bound to `<prefix>+T` which triggers a fzf-tmux popup that display zoxide results. Type the result you want and when you hit enter it will create a tmux session and connect to it or, if the sessions already exists, switch to it.

If you are not in tmux, you can simply run `t` to start the interactive script, or call `t {name}` to jump directly to a session of your choosing.

### Key Bindings

- `ctrl-s` list only tmux sessions
- `ctrl-z` list only zoxide results
- `ctrl-d` list directories (or find if fd isn't installed)

You can learn more about how the script works in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_TTxc0AcCw).

## How to add a custom keybinding

In order to add your own custom key binding to trigger the `t` script, add the following to your `tmux.conf`:

```
bind-key J run-shell "t"
```

## Tasks
