authentication via ssh-key
-------------------------

1.  CREATE KEY-PAIR ON WORKSTATION

a.  needed openssh installed: > sudo pacman -S openssh

b.  in terminal: > ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C "jan.vanhest@gmail.com"
    creates 2 key-files in ~/.ssh and asks for passphrase.
    (when using ssh-key to authenticate the passphrase will be asked.)
    private key: id_ed25519
    public key:  id_ed25519.pub

2.  ADD PRIVATE KEY TO SSH-AGENT

a.  check if ssh-agent is running: > $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

b.  add key to ssh-agent: > ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

3.  ADD PUBLIC KEY TO YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT

1.  open public key file in editor and copy the content.

2.  go to the settings page of your github account
    in the sidebar click: SSH and GPG keys
    after that click Add SSH key.
    title -> name of workstation
    type -> authentication
    key -> paste clipboard
    and Add SSH key

3.  test new key by ssh into github.com: > ssh -T git@github.com
    respons:
    > The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
    > ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
    > Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
    answer yes -> host github is added to known_hosts file of workstation

4.  PUSH GIT REPO TO REMOTE (GITHUB) USING SSH
    > git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git
    where <username> is your GitHub username and <repository> is the name of your repository.
    > git push -u origin main
